I've completely redesigned the calculator to work with virtual touch buttons. Now you can point at the buttons with your index finger and they'll respond like a real touchscreen!

*How It Works:

#Touch Gesture:

Point with your INDEX finger (extend only index finger, keep others closed)
Touch the virtual buttons on the screen
The button will light up when you hover over it
Press by touching the button area with your fingertip

*Key Features:
